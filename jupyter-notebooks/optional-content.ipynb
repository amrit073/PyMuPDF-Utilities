Python, a versatile and powerful programming language, has numerous libraries to aid in this process. One of these libraries is PyMuPDF, a wrapper around the popular MuPDF library.\n","\n","PyMuPDF offers an intuitive and efficient interface to easily work with PDF files. Both, its range of functions and its performance make it a leader among Python PDF libraries.\n","\n","In this blog post, we will look at a PDF feature hardly any other package seems to be bothering about: **PDF Optional Content.** We will be covering the following topics:\n","\n","1.

An object's visibility can be made dependent on the bool value of a special other object type, a so-called Optional Content Group (OCG).\n","\n","OCGs may be true or false (\"ON\" or \"OFF\"). A PDF object (text, image, vector graphics, etc.) will be invisible (visible) if there is an OCG object attached to it that has the status OFF (ON). Any object can only have one OCG attached to it.\n","\n","A PDF with optional content will usually contain multiple OCGs. Different configurations of OCG states may be stored in separate so-called **layers**, which can be activated - either temporarily or permanently - and will thus set the state of many OCGs at the same time - and hence the visibility of many PDF objects.\n","\n","A PDF will always have a standard OC layer (or none if without Optional Content support). The standard layer is the one activated when the PDF is being openend.\n","\n","More complexity comes into play with **OCMD**s (Optional Content Membership Dictionaries): Those are logical expressions of the state of one or more OCGs within any given layer.\n","\n","As mentioned, the visibility of any PDF object can only depend on **_one_** item. **_But_** that item may also be an OCMD, the state of which can depend on multiple OCGs. So a condition like **_\"show this text if OCG1 is not ON\"_** can be put in an OCMD and attached to the text.\n","\n","The Optional Content capability is useful in complex PDF documents containing items such as CAD drawings, technical construction plans, layered artwork, maps, or multi-language documents."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## How to create a PDF with layers\n","In this section we will create a bilingual PDF page from scratch, which shows English and alternatively German text in rectangle with gray background and a blue border.\n","\n","The standard page appearance will show the English text and the rectangle.

    "## Background\n",
    "All text searches and extractions in PyMuPDF under the hood work in 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Step 1 creates a \"TextPage\" object, which parses the document page and extracts its content based on a number of flags (which control whether e.g. images should also be included in the results). Execution time of this step is **always longer** than that of the second step.\n",
    "2. Step 2 walks through the **TextPage's content** and generates the requested output (simple text, HTML, search result rectangles, etc). When finished, the textpage is destroyed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> MuPDF's major motivation to entertain the object type \"TextPage\" was to abstract from the filetype a certain document happens to have: only the logic for creating a textpage is different between a PDF, XPS, HTML or whatever document: the application-side logic to create the desired result is not impacted by the document type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide an intuitively simple, easy-to-use API, PyMuPDF does not bother the programmer with these details: every text search or text extraction looks the same for all document types and hence creates and deletes a TextPage every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Optical Character Recognition also happens inside TextPage creation and, because this may entail a significant execution time, it now does make sense to offer a way to reuse a TextPage and avoid multiple, potentially expensive creations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the main motivation was OCR, reusing a TextPage object is now **always** possible. It is not bound to OCR in any way."

    "## Background\n",
    "All text searches and extractions in PyMuPDF under the hood work in 2 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Step 1 creates a \"TextPage\" object, which parses the document page and extracts its content based on a number of flags (which control whether e.g. images should also be included in the results). Execution time of this step is **always longer** than that of the second step.\n",
    "2. Step 2 walks through the **TextPage's content** and generates the requested output (simple text, HTML, search result rectangles, etc). When finished, the textpage is destroyed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "> MuPDF's major motivation for object \"TextPage\" was to abstract from the document type: only the logic for creating a textpage is different between a PDF, XPS, EPUB, etc. The application-side logic to create the desired result is not impacted by the document type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to break up text search and extraction into the above two steps. Whenever you need to do multiple searches or extractions on the same document page, you can base them all on the same TextPage and that way gain considerable performance improvements."

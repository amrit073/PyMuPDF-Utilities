# PyMuPDF Reporting

This folder provides examples for using PyMuPDF's reporting feature.

Each example is contained in a sub-folder of `examples`, usually the script together with all necessary data to use it.

The names of the sub-folders should give an idea what the respective report is trying to achieve. Each sub-folder will also contain its own README file that explains any specifics of the example.

Please also do have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Utilities/blob/master/reporting/documentation-draft.md) draft to understand how to use this exciting new feature.

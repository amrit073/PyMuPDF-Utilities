    "\n",
    "* Similar to e-books, TXT Documents are **_reflowable_**. Therefore, page dimension and font size can be changed at any time.\n",
    "* All characters are regarded as having the same font size, which has been set during open or `doc.layout()` (in points, 1 point = 1/72 inches).\n",
    "* Pages have fixed left and right margins of twice the font size.\n",
    "* Text may have been written in ASCII, UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding. Therefore, any language is acceptable and a wide range of files may be accessed as TXT documents.\n",
    "* Depending on the Unicode encountered, a suitable font is chosen from the [Noto](https://notofonts.github.io/) fonts.\n",
    "    - In our example, Latin characters use the 'Nimbus Mono PS Regular' (Courier) font and have a width of `0.6 * fontsize`. Chinese (also Japanese and Korean) characters are represented by the 'Droid Sans Fallback Regular' font and have a width of `fontsize`.\n",
    "* When TXT Documents are created from files, file name extensions **\".txt\"** and **\".text\"** are automatically recognized. In other cases, the `filetype` parameter must be used.\n",
    "* Like any other document type, TXT Documents may also be **_opened from memory_** via `fitz.open(\"txt\", binary-data)`."

# PyMuPDF Examples

This directory contains a bunch of examples to help you create PDF, XPS, and eBook applications with PyMuPDF.

## Disclaimer

Some of the examples were initially created in the early days of the package. API changes implemented over time may have caused discrepancies in the scripts. We're not updating them every time an update is released, and there is no guarantee they all will work as originally expected. If you look at the scripts as what they are intended to be, examples, then they will give you a good start.

> At the moment the `examples` folder is being restructured by using a self-explanatory naming convention.

## Conventions

As a rule of thumb, subfolders are named `<action-object>` as if pointing out an action to be performed on an object, e.g. `attach-images`. Python scripts are then named `<action.py>`, e.g. `attach.py`. Thus, the `attach.py` script in the `attach-images` folder is meant to attach all images found in the `attach-images/input` directory. Input files and folders are provided to run the examples. Input filenames are called `input`, e.g. `input.pdf`. Output filenames are called `output`, e.g. `output.pdf`.

The input files are distributed under either a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license or a [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html) (GFDL) while images are shared under the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/license) license.

For further information on how a particular example is to be run please read the documentation section at the beginning of each script.

Traversal with a for loop

A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time.
Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something
to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a
traversal.

One way to write a traversal is with a while loop:

index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1

This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The
loop condition is index < len(fruit), so when index is equal to the length of
the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop doesnâ€™t run. The
last character accessed is the one with the index len(fruit)-1, which is the
last character in the string.
